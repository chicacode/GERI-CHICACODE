## Learning to code has changed my mind

A few years ago, when I had just finished my bachelor’s degree in psychology, I began teaching the psychology of arts to university students of design. I shared my knowledge through weekly seminars and explored complex topics like how the human mind works, how we perceive the world around us, and how language structures thought. Each person had a different learning process and ways of processing new information.

So, I decided to do a masters degree in Psychology of creativity, in Barcelona, in order to continue delving into my internal debates. It was there that I learned about topics such as design thinking, the psychology of branding, and how a creator, in order to develop their work, owes a lot to communication.

At this stage, I finally began getting closer to synthesizing what I was looking for in a more optimal way. Then, while reflecting on the evolution of western society during the 20th and 21st century, I realized that we are developing something unparalleled in history. This, in other words, was the explosion of technology in creativity and communication.

I learned, for example, what the text markup languages are (i.e. HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS), and even a little bit of JavaScript, which has all allowed me to create new and dynamic content. Although, I’m currently working as a Frontend Developer for a amazing Startup in Barcelona where we are creating solutions for Mental health, which is an amazing company and I’m grateful to be there and be part of this movement in Virtual Reality and Mental health, at this moment of my life I want to become a very detail pixel oriented Frontend Developer a person who can create and build innovate solutions for an amazing big tech company that is continuously innovating and challenging the spheres of the present and future in this world. I want to land a dream job as a Front End Engineer developing custom software with HML, CSS and JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Node, sharing and collaborating with a team of top engineering's, and continue providing my knowledge and support to future generations. Improving my soft skills like communication, team work, empathy, creativity, adaptability, among others.

I want to be part of the disruption that technology is causing in the world and if it is possible to learn how to develop in Solidity and create something on the web 3.

I used to be a person who only observed and analyzed the world through Psychology and now I am a person who creates the future with technology
